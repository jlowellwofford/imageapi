# ImageAPI

The ImageAPI describes a restful (Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0) interface for attching, mounting, and launching system image containers.

This is desgined to provide a flexible and efficient mechanism to deploy system images to stateless clusters.

This service is likely much more useful when combined with a tool like [Kraken](https://github.com/hpc/kraken) that can automate the image attach/load process in conjuction with network booting.

The API specification is contained in [swagger.yaml](swagger.yaml) .

It can also be browsed on [SwaggerHub](https://swaggerhub.com).
